# on-statistical-consequences-of-fat-tails

Here you can find my Mathematica Wolfram codebase to understand better some key points on the book Statistical Consequences of Fat Tails by Nicolas Nassim Taleb. Serve yourself if you find then useful, and get in touch if you like to discuss something. 

My unrequested advice for this book is to really try to reproduce the results are some definitions on the book actually need footnotes and comments, which 
you only get by going through examples yourself.
